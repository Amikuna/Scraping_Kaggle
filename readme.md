# Scraping kaggle
In this project I am scraping data from [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com). The script sends HTTP POST requests to Kaggle's API endpoint and retrieves a JSON response containing information about the datasets. This JSON response contains a variety of information about Kaggle datasets. I selected the values that were important to me and stored all the data in a pandas DataFrame, which I then saved as a CSV file.
